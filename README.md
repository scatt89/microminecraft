**Microminecraft** is a little world map built with blocks like the famous game called _Minecraft_. I've coded this game like a project for the _Computer Graphics_ signature of the _URJC_ University (Madrid, Spain).
The purpose of post this project is not generate any economic benefit but Help some one who wants to learn _OpenGL_ basics.

## Introduction
In this game you are in an simulated environment where the gamer can play in creative mode, building in the map that he wants from the preset blocks. The cam mode is set in first person and you can move through the little world. There is some objects already created in the scene, like trees, fences, a little house, a few blocks and some disturbing sheep who have the teleport ability.

## Screen shots


## Instructions to create blocks
* To create a block you must press the key of the block type you want create: '1','2','3','4','5'.
* Once the block has appeared on screen you can move the block position with the keys 'a','w','d','s' (left, up, right, down), '↑', '↓' (forward, back) and 'r' (rotate).
* Once the block has been placed in position the gamer must press the 'i' key to introduce the block in the scene. Then the block will not move again.
* Now you can create another blocks.
